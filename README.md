In your terminal (command prompt for windows), type the following:
<pre>
  init
  build
  run
</pre>

These are batch scripts which automatically compile the source using cl compiler provided by Visual Studio.

init.bat initialises the environment for cl to be used.
<br>build.bat compiles the source to an executable.
<br>run.bat runs the executable.
